Hi I am Oli, 28 years old and a graduate of "Wirtschaftsinformatik" (M.Sc.) at Karlsruhe University. Literally translated this means Economics Computer Science but is also known as Business Information Systems. Glad you are taking the time to take a look at my little slice of the web. For Details on my professional journey until now, you can look at my CV found under the respective menu item.

Professionally I aim for a career in Cybersecurity and one reason for this website is to document my journey to become adept in this field, and include some write-ups for guides (mainly for my own reference, so I do not have to use my hundreds of bookmarks...) and eventually CTF challenges like those on https://tryhackme.com/.

Other than that I am interested in Data Science/Machine Learning, Company/Stock Analysis, and other closely-related IT/Business topics. 

Further, I am passionate about history (but I am only an armchair historian and do not claim any professional expertise) and also enjoy Scuba-diving and guitar. Like most of my generation I also like playing the odd video game if time allows.

About this Website
---

This website is an ongoing personal project.
I created it using hugo and the m10c theme. The website is hosted on github pages and thus static. Check out my github for details on my code structure, but basically I made one production repo and one submodule repo I deploy to via the public folder which is where hugo makes the actual website build, so I can organize my code better. 

I want to credit my friend Jesse Yu-Chieh Kuo from my taiwan exchange semester and his website (check it out at https://ujkuo.github.io/) for inspiration.

Also check out my Aunt In√©s' website at https://www.inesdawson.com/. She makes cool educational content related to many fields in science and holds a PhD in Biology from Oxford University.
